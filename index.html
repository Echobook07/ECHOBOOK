				RICH DAD, POOR DAD is written by <b>Robert Kiyosaki</b>
				This book teach us how rich people thinks and how they work.
				Emphasizes the importance of financial literacy and building assets over relying on a traditional job for income, advocating for a mindset shift towards financial independence and wealth creation through investing and smart financial decisions.Financial Education is Key.
				The story begins with the author as a young boy, observing the contrasting financial mindsets and behaviors of his own father, the "poor dad," and a friend's father, the "rich dad." The poor dad held a high position in education and emphasized the importance of academic success, job security, and living within one's means. The rich dad, a successful entrepreneur, believed in building assets, investing wisely, and acquiring financial knowledge. It describes how the rich dad teaches the author and his friend finance through practical lessons.

			<a href="#">The intelligent investor will never exit a stock position purely in response to share price movement. He / she will always first ask whether the value of the company's underlying businesses has changed and then react accordingly. The intelligent investor only pays attention to the current stock price when it suits him.What Does "The Intelligent Investor" Teach You? “The Intelligent Investor” is widely considered to be the definitive text on value investing. According to Graham, investors should analyze a company's financial reports and its operations but ignore the market noise.This book will not teach you how to beat the market. However, it will teach you how to reduce risk, protect your capital from loss and reliably generate sustainable returns over the long run. Warren Buffett calls the Intelligent Investor "by far the best book on investing ever written." The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham gives you everything you need to equip yourself with the investor's mindset necessary to avoid the panic of market fluctuations that plague the ordinary investor. Don’t be ordinary. Be intelligent.</a></div>
